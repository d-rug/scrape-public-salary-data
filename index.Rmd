# Overview {-}

Data is all over the internet. Some of it is already structured -- tables and databases that are already stored online -- and much of it is unstructured -- information stored on websites, all organized under different formats. This lesson is going to provide an example of web-scraping for each.  

The project today is learn how to scrape data from public salary database, https://transparentcalifornia.com/. I'm specifically interested in looking for faculty salaries of the department I work in. So, we will be scraping unstructured data -- names from a departmental webpage -- using regular expressions to clean it up, and then using that to iteratively scrape a structured database of public salaries.
